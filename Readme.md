# Introduction

Learning algorithms and data structures is very crucial for a programmer.

Also i was curious and interested in reading the "Introduction to Algorithms" for a very long time now. But now the time has come. I would be studying the algorithms and data structures now and subsequently implementing them here.

I'm very excited. So let's explore the realms of algorithms and data structures...
